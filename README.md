<p>
There are 100 prisoners and everybody must find their number which is hidden in 100 boxes, but they have only 50 tries of finding it. What is the best strategy they could use?

<p>
  The best strategy is finding a box with your number, if your number is not inside, go to the box with number you found inside previous box and repeat until you find it.

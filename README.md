<p>
There are 100 convicts, and each one must locate their unique number, which is concealed in 100 boxes. However, they only have 50 attempts to do so. What would be the best course of action for them?
</p>
<p>
Finding a box with your number inside is the ideal tactic; if it's not there, go to the box with the number you discovered within the previous box, and keep doing this until you do.

# My Code
<p>
  After reading the solution of the problem I was still confused and doubtful about how using such a strategy improves your chance of to 31%
<p>
  Decided to create my a replica of the game Using very simple functions and recursion
</p>
<p>
  Then after running the game many times I plot the result and to my surprise the result was exactly around 31%
